My old 8-tracks music client originally built for Windows Phone, this may be an interesting reference for someone.

There are some interesting design patterns in this code based, much of it experimental but extremely performant 
on a light device like a Windows Phone.

# History

I was a huge fan of 8-tracks, and wanted to make an app for the Windows Phone store, I thought this would be a fun experiment.

Version 1.0 was released late 2011 into the Windows Phone marketplace and by the time of it's downfall 
had about 250k downloads with an average of a 4.8 out of 5 star rating. 

Sadly around 2013 8-tracks revoked access to the service everyone outside the US and Canada and as a result I could
no longer maintain the project. It was frustrating because there were many people asking me for fixes but there was nothing I could do.
